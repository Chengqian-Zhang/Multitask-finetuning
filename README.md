The folder `examples/` provides input files and training command of QM9 band gap prediction task.

The folder `data/` provides the training data of downstream property prediciton task and auxiliary force-field task in `deepmd/npy` format.

The folder `scripts/` provides the scripts to reproduce the figures and table results in our paper.

Firstly, one needs to install `deepmd-kit` software following https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/stable/install/easy-install.html.
Then you can run the examples in this repository.
